#NLP Text Classification Project#

Project Title:
NLP-Based Text Classification Model

Submitted By:
Khushi Dewanand Narad

Description:
This project involves building a text classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify input text into appropriate categories based on its content and context.

The Google Colab Notebook (NLP_Text_Classification_Khushi.ipynb) covers:

Text preprocessing and cleaning

Feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Model training and evaluation

Performance analysis using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Technologies Used:

Python

Google Colab

NLP Libraries:

NLTK

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Machine Learning Algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (or others if applied)

How to Run:

Open the file NLP_Text_Classification_Khushi.ipynb in Google Colab.

Run all cells sequentially for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed (Colab usually has them pre-installed):

bash

Copy

Edit

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk

If an external dataset is used, upload it to the Colab session or load it directly as mentioned inside the notebook.

Results:

The model achieves [mention achieved accuracy here]% accuracy (or another metric like F1-score) on the test data, demonstrating successful text classification.

Important Notes:

Ensure that the runtime type in Colab is set to Python 3.

All necessary libraries should be imported at the beginning of the notebook.

Execute all cells in order to avoid runtime errors.
